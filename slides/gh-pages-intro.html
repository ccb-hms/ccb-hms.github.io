# Background

- GitHub is a good place to share long-from reports, especially works in progress

	- Markdown documents are rendered nicely as HTML

	- Handles links, figures, etc.

	- CCB uses it extensively
	
- Drawbacks

	- No custom HTML / styles / Javascript

--

- We wanted to make some searchable tables publicly available (requires javascript)

- One option is to use the CCB Harvard website (but coordination with project teams may be difficult)

--

- Convenient alternative: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

---

# GitHub Pages: Structure


- One "main" page per user / organization: <https://ccb-hms.github.io>

- Every project can set up a sub-page: <https://ccb-hms.github.io/phonto/>
	
- Each sub-page can be modified independently

---

# GitHub Pages: Summary

- Designate a particular folder or branch as GH Pages branch

- For the most part, works as a standard web server

- Most files, including HTML files, are served in usual manner

--

- The most __interesting__ aspect is that is supports [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

	- Describes itself as a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator"
	
	- Like wordpress, but using markdown files as source

# Demo / Examples

- Main CCB page: 

	- Website: <https://ccb-hms.github.io/> 
	
	- Source: <https://github.com/ccb-hms/ccb-hms.github.io/>

- Phonto sub-page:

	- Website: <https://ccb-hms.github.io/phonto/> 
	
	- Source: <https://github.com/ccb-hms/phonto>/docs

--

- Official docs: <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart>

- Some more details about Jekyll below

---

# Jekyll

- Converts markdown to HTML

- Can be run locally (written in ruby) â€” to preview or generate static version

- GitHub Pages converts markdown / HTML pages automatically

- Generated HTML files do not need not be stored in `git` repository

--

- Supports templates

- Supports some programmatic content 

- Uses a template language called Liquid <https://shopify.github.io/liquid/>

---

# Jekyll basics

- Document-specific variables defined through YML metadata in markdown files

- Available as nested lists in template file, e.g. <code>{</code><code>{ page.title }</code><code>}</code>, as in


- The <code>{</code><code>{ ... }</code><code>}</code> and <code>{</code><code>% ... %</code><code>}</code> blocks are examples of [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)

- The template itself is specifed as the [`template`](https://github.com/ccb-hms/ccb-hms.github.io/) variable

- The main (markdown / HTML) content is available as the `content` variable

---

# Examples: Table of contents using Liquid

- Templates can include other files, which is very useful

- Example: <https://github.com/ccb-hms/phonto/blob/main/docs/_layouts/default.html#L53>

- Liquid can do more [complicated things](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc) (but I wouldn't recommend it unless really needed)
